    <p class="page-normal-text">A new school year is approaching and the orientation team is looking to you for some design expertise. Design an experience for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations.

As I read the prompt for the first time, I suddenly had flashbacks to freshman fall of college. I remember those feelings of excitement, nervousness, and even anxiety as freshman version of me went about the first two weeks of school. Finding clubs and organizations that could possibly alter the course of my college experience was a daunting task as well. Like many colleges, Dartmouth doesn’t have an organized platform to explore and propose new clubs/student organizations, only a chaotic and loud club fair at the beginning of every school. There must be a better solution to replace all of those sign up forms and Excel spreadsheets— a platform that helps overwhelmed students find and explore the half outside of college that is so important to a well-rounded education.

    </div>


    <p class="page-normal-text"> We looked at various social media platforms to see how their user flow encouraged discussion and
      interaction. For example, platforms like Instagram and Facebook encourage reviews through quantitative
      measurements (e.g. number of likes), and this measurement puts pressure on the user to post popular
      posts that appealed to the mass audience. On Reddit, discussion is organized in a hierarchy so
      that the most liked comments are displayed first. For forums, discussion in posts and comments
      is usually chronologically ordered, creating an equal but often unorganized discussion that can
      branch into several sub-discussions.
    </p>


    <h2 class="page-small-title"> User Interviews</h2>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> As part of my research, I interviewed eight students, three of whom would be incoming college freshman next fall. I thought it would both be useful to gather information from existing college students who could reflect on their freshman year selves and share their experiences exploring new clubs and organizations, as well as getting information from incoming college students and their emotions and concerns.

      A broad range of emotions, quotes, and experiences came up, but I think I was able to categorize them into four main user personas.

      Shy/nervous
      Excited to try new things
      Overwhelmed with change
      Determined/confident

      Each of the four personas had different user needs, but I was able to better empathize with each of the four groups while creating user flows later in the design process.

    <p class="page-small-title"> Feature Brainstorming and Low-Fis
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the earliest things I had to consider was what type of device should my platform be designed for. With how accessible mobile devices are, I had to consider the pros and cons of developing a mobile app. However, from my user interviews and personal experiences, it seemed that much of Dartmouth’s “onboarding” experience for students existed through websites. As a result, it seemed that a website would be the most appropriate and cohesive way to reach students.

      Some features would need to be clear inclusions into the platform that I designed, including a search function, category organization, and club description pages.

      But there were also additional features that I thought would tackle some of the harder, more complex user needs.

      Finding others similar to you
      Inclusivity and welcoming
      Exploration

      Features that should be explained more
      “Interests” and onboarding - finding others similar to you, welcoming
      Club descriptions that are actual useful - just common sense
      Recommendations and saving for later - exploration

    </p>

    <p class="page-small-title"> The Hybrid Comment System
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the biggest challenges during the ideate phase was coming up with a comment section design
      that promoted equal discussion while still maintaining some level of organization. We didn't want
      to use Reddit's hierarchy system because we felt it promoted only 'top' comments and felt jumbled
      after the initial branches. We also wanted more organization that just a simple chronological system
      in most forums because it can be hard to track where the discussion is going.

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text">After brainstorming several features of the platform, I knew I had to start transferring some of the
       rough feature sketches to actual low fidelity wireframes. This process helped me flesh out some of the edge cases a
       nd interactions of the “Interests” feature, as well editing the clubs that a user had joined or saved for later.</p>

    <p class="page-normal-text "> For example, we quickly found that users felt that three different types of reactions to a post would
      be excessive. Although they associated each reaction with a different emotion when interviewed, in practice they felt no difference
      between the three when using them as well as receiving them on posts.
    </p>
    <p class="page-normal-text ">
      Additionally, we were able to get positive feedback
      on our idea of allowing users to like each other's posts, but not sharing the number of likes to
      anyone. Our test users felt that this would encourage commenting as the main form of interaction,
      but also retain the small channels of feedback that we have been accustomed to when posting online.

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We designed with cool and warm colors that promoted comfort and low-stress. For our main fonts, we
      decided to use Comfortaa because of its gentle curves in titles, and used Lato for clean and clear
      readability in the posts themselves. Additionally, we wanted to use images and icons that contributed
      to our comforting atmosphere, seeking inspiration from the outdoors!</p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One interesting feature that received overwhelmingly positive feedback was our concept of "Question of the Day"
      element. We believed that this would be a more encouraging than a simple "Post" section. Our initial idea was that there would be rotating
      questions of the day that would act as conversation starters for people to engage with the platform. Additionally, the "Share a thought" button
      was just one example of the attention to tone and language that we took when designing the final mockups for Unmasked.

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text "> Moving forward (hypothetically if it was a real project), I would aim to conduct usability testing for many of the “Interest” features to gauge users’ understanding of how the features work. As I continue to build more high fidelity screens and interactions, I also believe there would be edge cases that I had not considered— thus I would need to reiterate and user test.

    As a whole, I wish that colleges would have created a similar platform for incoming students.
