    <p class="page-normal-text"> In the spring of 2018, Dartmouth students from the Student Wellness Center partnered with the DALI
      LAB and asked us to design and create a mobile application. The idea behind the app was to create
      a discussion platform in which Dartmouth students would be able to discuss mental health and personal
      issues without fear of judgement.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-small-title"> Mental Health by the Numbers</h3>
    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item"><b>More than 25%</b> of college students have been diagnosed or treated for
        a mental health issue in the last year.</li>
      <li class="page-list-item"><b>40% of students</b> with diagnosable mental health conditions did not receive help.</li>
      <li class="page-list-item"><b>More than 80%</b> of college students felt overwhelmed by all they had to do in the
        past year and <b>45%</b> have felt things were hopeless.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> These statistics, provided by the National Alliance on Mental Health, highlighted a key issue
      that college students face across the nation, especially on Dartmouth's campus. Creating a discussion platform that allowed
      students to freely discuss mental health issues was just one step in the right direction, but we believed it was important to help
      bring mental health to the forefront of conversation on campus and would hopefully lead to more students services and support channels.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-small-title"> Anonymity and Discussion </h3>
    <p class="page-normal-text"> Through the initial meetings with our partners, they stressed two ideas:
      <b> anonymity and discussion. </b> They wanted users to remain anonymous, and they also wanted
      the app to focus around and foster healthy discussions. These principles would shape our decisions
      for the entire project.</p>

    <h3 class="page-small-title"> Initial design challenges </h3>
    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we create a safe and comfortable environment?</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we allow anonymous users to develop personal relationships with each other?</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we encourage discussion through the app design?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="page-small-title"> Social Media Platforms </h2>

    <div class="large-gif-container">
      <img class="large-gif" id="chart-analysis" src="../img/unmasked/social-media-analysis.PNG" />
    </div>


    <p class="page-normal-text"> We looked at various social media platforms to see how their user flow encouraged discussion and
      interaction. For example, platforms like Instagram and Facebook encourage reviews through quantitative
      measurements (e.g. number of likes), and this measurement puts pressure on the user to post popular
      posts that appealed to the mass audience. On Reddit, discussion is organized in a hierarchy so
      that the most liked comments are displayed first. For forums, discussion in posts and comments
      is usually chronoloigally ordered, creating an equal but often unorganized discussion that can
      branch into several sub-discussions.
    </p>


    <h2 class="page-small-title"> User Interviews</h2>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We interviewed 15 students from various majors, backgrounds, and social economic statuses in order
      to find what emotions and concerns people had for a discussion platform. We asked them about their
      social media use.
    </p>

    <h2 class="page-small-title">Things that we found important</h2>

    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item">The majority of the students said that the number of likes/upvotes
        definitely plays a large part in their social media experience. Many even agree that it often
        creates more pressure and stress.</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">Some of our interviewees mentioned that posting in a Reddit thread or a comment section can be
        intimidating.
      </li>
      <li class="page-list-item">Some believe that social media interactions are superficial and often a 'fake' best version of
        ourselves.
      </li>
    </ul>



    <div class="page-quote-background">
      <h1 class="page-large-quote"> "I love being able to connect with friends on social media. But it stresses me out to maintain this ideal
        image of myself."</h1>
      <h3 class="page-quote-author"> Dartmouth Student '20</h3>

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We knew we wanted to include elements of social media in the Unmasked app to promote interaction
      and discussion. But after our interviews, it was also clear that we should steer clear of certain
      aspects of social medal that can cause stress.</p>

    <!-- Ideate -->


    <p class="page-small-title"> Feature Brainstorming and Low-Fis
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> After our user research, we went through several brainstorming sessions to come up
      with ways in which our discussion platform would help solve the user needs.
    </p>

    <p class="page-small-title"> The Hybrid Comment System
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the biggest challenges during the ideate phase was coming up with a comment section design
      that promoted equal discussion while still maintaing some level of organization. We didn't want
      to use Reddit's hierarchy system because we felt it promoted only 'top' comments and felt jumbled
      after the initial branches. We also wanted more organization that just a simple chronological system
      in most forums because it can be hard to track where the discussion is going.
    </p>

    <div class="images-collage">

      <img class="example-image" width="375px" height="440px" src="../img/unmasked/comment-structure.gif"/>

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We felt that this system we created provided the best of both world. Since each initial comment usually
      responds to the original post in a new direction, we thought that these would be great 'converstaion
      starters'. Responses and comments in these sub-conversations would be grouped together to keep
      the discussion organized, while allowing new contributors to equally add to the conversation. Therefore,
      the comment section would encourage discussion while still maintaining some level of organization.
    </p>

    <p class="page-small-title"> Identicons
    </p>

    <div class="images-collage">

      <img id="identicon-gif" class="example-image" src="../img/unmasked/identicon-example.gif"/>

    </div>
    <p class="page-normal-text"> We stressed anonymity throughout the design phase, but we feared that total anonymity
      would discourage users from truly interacting with each other. We wanted users to be able to differentiate themselves
      from others, but also not label themselves through a username (which could cause issues with privacy or inappropriate names).
      As a result, we looked into how platforms like Yik Yak created user identifies through avatars without breaking anonymity.
      We came across Identicons, random shapes generated using a hash function from any string of characters.
      We believed that these identicons could help users connect with each other without clearly labeling a user as a certain avatar.
      The shapes offered just enough abstraction to help users blend in the crowd for normal users, but also help distinguish users
      during direct messages. Specifically, we wanted to use the JDenticon library, as shown above.
    </p>


    <p class="page-small-title"> Reactions
    </p>

    <div class="images-collage">

      <img src="../img/unmasked/reaction-draft.png" class="example-image" height="157px" width="375px"/>

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We knew we wanted to encourage genuine connections through Unmasked, but we questioned
      the use of "likes" that most social media platforms used as engagement. We brainstormed various ways that users could react,
      such as "Claps" or "Hearts" or even "Snaps". In our initial designs, we chose to include all three as possible reactions to a posts because
      we believed that each represented a different kind of support. Additionally, we opted to hide the quantity of each reaction on the post,
      instead only notifying the original poster of a reaction every few minutes. This way, users could feel the engagement from other users without
      the anxiety of achieving a number of reactions for each post. Thus, users would feel more comfortable being honest instead of trying to appeal
      to a broad audience.

      </div>

    </div>



    <p class="page-normal-text "> For example, we quickly found that users felt that three different types of reactions to a post would
      be excessive. Although they associated each reaction with a different emotion when interviewed, in practice they felt no difference
      between the three when using them as well as receiving them on posts.
    </p>
    <p class="page-normal-text ">
      Additionally, we were able to get positive feedback
      on our idea of allowing users to like each other's posts, but not sharing the number of likes to
      anyone. Our test users felt that this would encourage commenting as the main form of interaction,
      but also retain the small channels of feedback that we have been accustomed to when posting online.

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We designed with cool and warm colors that promoted comfort and low-stress. For our main fonts, we
      decided to use Comfortaa because of its gentle curves in titles, and used Lato for clean and clear
      readability in the posts themselves. Additionally, we wanted to use images and icons that contributed
      to our comforting atmosphere, seeking inspiration from the outdoors!</p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One interesting feature that received overwhelmingly positive feedback was our concept of "Question of the Day"
      element. We believed that this would be a more encouraging than a simple "Post" section. Our initial idea was that there would be rotating
      questions of the day that would act as conversation starters for people to engage with the platform. Additionally, the "Share a thought" button
      was just one example of the attention to tone and language that we took when designing the final mockups for Unmasked.

      a platform that encourages meaningful discussion. Our partners at the Student Wellness Center were
      overwhelmingly pleased with our progress throughout the term, and they hope that that a successful
      beta app with our designs will be implemented in the coming terms. </p>


    <p class="page-normal-text "> We hope that Unmasked shows the importance of the design process, especially the user research and
      ideate phases. Without our time and effort in these stages, we would have overlooked several aspects
      of our user experience and not considered how potential features could negatively affect the main
      purpose of the application.</p>
