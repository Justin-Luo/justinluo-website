    <p class="page-normal-text"> In the spring of 2018, Dartmouth students from the Student Wellness Center partnered with the DALI
      LAB and asked us to design and create a mobile application. The idea behind the app was to create
      a discussion platform in which Dartmouth students would be able to discuss mental health and personal
      issues without fear of judgement.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-small-title"> Anonymity and Discussion </h3>
    <p class="page-normal-text"> Through the initial meetings with our partners, they stressed two ideas:
      <b> anonymity and discussion. </b> They wanted users to remain anonymous, and they also wanted
      the app to focus around and foster healthy discussions. These principles would shape our decisions
      for the entire project.</p>

    <h3 class="page-small-title"> Initial design challenges </h3>
    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we create a safe and comfortable environment?</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we allow anonymous users to develop personal relationships with each other?</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">How might we encourage discussion through the app design?</li>

    <h2 class="page-small-title"> Social Media Platforms </h2>

    <div class="large-gif-container">
      <img class="large-gif" id="chart-analysis" src="../img/unmasked/social-media-analysis.PNG" />
    </div>


    <p class="page-normal-text"> We looked at various social media platforms to see how their user flow encouraged discussion and
      interaction. For example, platforms like Instagram and Facebook encourage reviews through quantitative
      measurements (e.g. number of likes), and this measurement puts pressure on the user to post popular
      posts that appealed to the mass audience. On Reddit, discussion is organized in a hierarchy so
      that the most liked comments are displayed first. For forums, discussion in posts and comments
      is usually chronoloigally ordered, creating an equal but often unorganized discussion that can
      branch into several sub-discussions.
    </p>


    <h2 class="page-small-title"> User Interviews</h2>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We interviewed 15 students from various majors, backgrounds, and social economic statuses in order
      to find what emotions and concerns people had for a discussion platform. We asked them about their
      social media use.
    </p>

    <h2 class="page-small-title">Things that we found important</h2>

    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item">Number of likes/upvotes does matter. The majority of our interviewers said that the number of likes/upvotes
        definitely plays a large part in their social media experience. Many even agree that it often
        creates more pressure and stress.</li>
      <li class="page-list-item">Some of our interviewees mentioned that posting in a Reddit thread or a comment section can be
        intimidating.
      </li>
      <li class="page-list-item">Some believe that social media interactions are superficial and often a 'fake' best version of
        ourselves.
      </li>
    </ul>



    <div class="page-quote-background">
      <h1 class="page-large-quote"> "I love being able to connect with friends on social media. But it stresses me out to maintain this ideal
        image of myself."</h1>
      <h3 class="page-quote-author"> Dartmouth Student '20</h3>

    </div>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We knew we wanted to include elements of social media in the Unmasked app to promote interaction
      and discussion. But after our interviews, it was also clear that we should steer clear of certain
      aspects of social medal that can cause stress.</p>

    <!-- Ideate -->


    <p class="page-small-title"> Sketches and Low-Fis
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the biggest challenges during the ideate phase was coming up with a comment section design
      that promoted equal discussion while still maintaing some level of organization. We didn't want
      to use Reddit's hierarchy system because we felt it promoted only 'top' comments and felt jumbled
      after the initial branches. We also wanted more organization that just a simple chronological system
      in most forums because it can be hard to track where the discussion is going.
    </p>

    <p class="page-small-title"> The Hybrid System
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We felt that this system we created provided the best of both world. Since each initial comment usually
      responds to the original post in a new direction, we thought that these would be great 'converstaion
      starters'. Responses and comments in these sub-conversations would be grouped together to keep
      the discussion organized, while allowing new contributors to equally add to the conversation. Therefore,
      the comment section would encourage discussion while still maintaining some level of organization.

    </div>



    <p class="page-normal-text "> For example, we quickly found that users felt that three different types of reactions to a post would
      be excessive and one 'like' button would suffice. Additionally, we were able to get positive feedback
      on our idea of allowing users to like each other's posts, but not sharing the number of likes to
      anyone. As a result, the original poster would only be notified occasionally of people generally
      liking their post or comment.

    <p class="page-normal-text "> We designed with cool and warm colors that promoted comfort and low-stress. For our main fonts, we
      decided to use Comfortaa because of its gentle curves in titles, and used Lato for clean and clear
      readability in actually posts. Additionally, we wanted to use images and icons that contributed
      to our comforting atmosphere. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text "> After our product demo, multiple students and faculty members complemented our ability to create
      a platform that encourages meaningful discussion. Our partners at the Student Wellness Center were
      overwhelmingly pleased with our progress throughout the term, and they hope that that a successful
      beta app with our designs will be implemented in the coming terms. </p>


    <p class="page-normal-text "> We hope that Unmasked shows the importance of the design process, especially the user research and
      ideate phases. Without our time and effort in these stages, we would have overlooked several aspects
      of our user experience and not considered how potential features could negatively affect the main
      purpose of the application.</p>
