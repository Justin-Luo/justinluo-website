    <p class="page-normal-text"> We wanted to start with the most common form of communication in today's world: text messages. Our
      goal was to analyze Messager and iMessage conversations on macOS computers, and share the data
      back with the user. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> Through our user interviews, we were met with mixed opinions about a text message analyzing service.
      Some were concerned about overanalyzing their relationships. Others believed that a service like
      Left On Read would be a shallow representation of a relationship. But one user quote defined a
      new focus for our team...

    <p class="page-normal-text"> From this point, we knew we had to focus on creating a comfortable and trusting environment for the
      user to interact with the website. We looked at how other websites that handled sensitve information,
      and drew inspiration from Apple, Google and even 23andMe. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> By creating user personas for different user groups that we identified through our interviews, we
      were able to empathize with our target audience and dive into the project with their needs and
      wants in mind.

    <p class="page-normal-text"> We wanted to get the data to the user as quick as possible, and therefore we chose to make user flow
      as straightforward as possible. In terms of the user interface, we also believed a minimalistic,
      modern design would help build our website's credibility. With the minimalist design and a straightforward
      user flow, we aimed to create a clean user experience that flowed with each step of the experience.</p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> For example, initial mockups included a navigation bar at the top of each page. However, we eventually
      decided to remove it because it cluttered our design and offered little benefit, giving that our
      site navigation was already straightforward.
    </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the main constraints that we worked within was the upload process for the 'chat.db' file on
      Apple computers that contained all of the text conversations. Because of how the file is stored,
      we needed to provide clear instructions to the user during the upload process. We bounced around
      several ideas, from a slideshow tutorial process to even making a short GIF outlining the process.
      This crucial part of the user flow was something we tested and reiterated multiple times during
      the prototype phase. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> A week before our project was due, we released a prototype to the rest of our class and sought feedback.
      Suggestions included... </p>
    <ul class="page-list">
      <li class="page-list-item"> "Love the minimalist design, but wish it wasn't so static"</li>
      <li class="page-list-item"> "Instructions are kind of confusing" </li>
      <li class="page-list-item"> "Love the quantitative data, but wish there was more analysis about the emotion behind the words."</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> From the feedback, we knew which parts we had to improve before launch day. We added moments of 'delight'
      to our project, including fade in animations and a revamped loading screen. We also iterated on
      several different versions for our upload instructions, eventually setlling on simple text commands
      after further user testing. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> One of the biggest things that we took away from our prototype stage was the fact that our users
      wanted more than just quantitative data. Our biggest addition was a sentiment analysis system,
      in which we looked for key words that indicated happiness, anger, stress, love, and outgoingness
      (which we called the 'social' sentiment). </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text"> Originally, we just displayed scores for each sentiment in the analytics, but we began to see a larger
      potential for the new sentiment. For example, we created a 'Reconnect' graph that displayed contacts
      with high love sentiment, but hadn't been in communication for a period of time.

    <p class="page-normal-text "> From the outstanding positive feedback from both our peers and faculty, we knew that we wanted to
      expand Left On Read to our friends and family, and possibly even the world. </p>

    <p class="page-normal-text "> Even from the start, we knew that Left On Read wasn't going to change the world. We were first interested
      in the project because of the proposed challenge of parsing texts and displaying analytics. But
      we tapped into a service that catches almost everyone's curiosity, and we want to share the feeling
      of exploration when we first got our data. It was clear that people loved to see data about themselves.</p>

    <p class="page-normal-text "> Since the end of spring 2018, we have been working on a design overhaul and preparing for a mass
      launch to the rest of the world. Check out what we're up to at leftonread.me </p>
